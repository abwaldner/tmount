      LUKS container unlocking process essentially depends on
  the particular environment.  Therefore, the default configuration of
  "tmount" does not define of any action for such devices.
      You can select the appropriate scripts available in the directory
  /usr/share/tmount/docs (or in a subdirectory of the project directory
  ./examples), modify them to meet your needs and preferences, put them
  at any place available for execution and edit the "Unlock" and "Lock"
  fields of "Settings" dialog of "tmount".
      Unlocking command takes a parameter is the same as the mount
  command.
      Locking command takes as parameter the name, which opens the
  container in the directory /dev/mapper "cryptsetup" utility (without
  the directory name).
      Unlock command requires interactive input of LUKS passphrase or
  of key file name, and both commands may require interactive input of
  password, if implemented through the use of "su" or "sudo".
  Therefore, "tmount" by default launches them without setting
  a timeout.  Be careful: in this case these scripts hang blocking
  the application.  For this reason, the containers will never be
  unlocked automatically.
      The "pmount" program can by itself unlock LUKS container and can
  automatically lock it after unmounting contained to it filesystem and
  does not require an explicit call to the utility "cryptsetup".
  However, it can't unlock nested containers and containers that do not
  contain a filesystem.
      "udevil" users must add at least "/dev/dm*" to the parameter
  "allowed_internal_devices" in udevil.conf file.
      "sudo" users can greatly simplify the work with the utility
  "cryptsetup", if will be entitled to its execution without entering
  a password.  However, this does not require any modification of the
  scripts.  In addition, when using terminal emulators or tools like
  "ktsuss" (http://github.com/nomius/ktsuss, the graphical version of
  "su") lost the return code and the stderr output of the called
  program.  Therefore, the use of these variants is not recommended.
  To work with "su", it is preferable to use the "expect" script.
      Currently, all unlock scripts accept an additional parameter
  specifying the way to enter the LUKS password: "-k" - request the key
  file name, "-i" - interactive input, "-a" or the absence of the
  parameter - the selection dialog.
      To unlock containers that are in regular files, you should ensure
  that the relevant scripts are run through the field "Add image" of
  the settings dialog (see img-*.sh in examles).   Warning: don't forget
  to change the timeout value.  Note: the "pumount" program works
  incorrectly in this case, therefore it is necessary pre-unlock
  the container and add "/dev/dm-*" to the "/etc/pmount.allow" file.
      Implementation notes:
      Use in the examples of the "qarma" program
  (http://github.com/luebking/qarma) and own wrapper for setting of
  the SUDO_ASKPASS evironment variable provides a view that resembles
  the application as much as possible.  You can also use the programs
  "zenity" (https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Zenity),
  "Xdialog" (http://xdialog.free.fr),
  "gtkdialog" (https://github.com/oshazard/gtkdialog), or
  "yad" (https://sourceforge.net/projects/yad-dialog),
  the corresponding functions are listed in the files "dialogs.sh" and
  "dialogs.tcl".  Also you can use "Expect+Tk" (*.expk) scripts.
