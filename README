   tmount - block devices mounter/unmounter for system tray on Linux.

  Alexander B. Waldner, 2016.  See COPYING file for terms of usage.

      "tmount" is an application, that starts in system tray (aka
  notification area), then lists and monitors via "udev" all filesystem-
  contains block devices and offers mounting/unmounting.  In addition,
  the application can operate as automounter for hotplug devices and
  removable media.
      Actions are selected (toggled) from menu, wich shown on left-
  button click on the tray icon.  Context (right-click activated) menu
  of that icon contains the "Settings" and "Quit" items.

     By default "tmount" use "udevil"
  (https://ignorantguru.github.com/udevil/) for mounting/unmountig.  You
  can use any other appropriate program or your own script by editing
  "Mount command" and "Unmount command" fields in "Settings" dialog
  window.  The device node name (b.e. /dev/sdc1 or /dev/sr0) will be
  appended to the end of given command line for mount and eject commands
  and the mountpoint pathname will be appended for unmount command.  For
  example, for use of the "pmount" program
  (http://pmount.alioth.debian.org/) just type "pmount" and "pumount" in
  appropriate fields.  To disable the media ejection from the ejection-
  capable devices after unmounting, just set "Eject command" field to
  empty.
      By default "tmount" shows all block devices and partitions
  containing the filesystem.  To hide some of them, for example the root
  file system, type a space-separated list of these devices (b.e.
  "/dev/sda3 /dev/sdb1" to the "Hidden devices" field and restart the
  application.
      The options "Mount New", "Mount media", and "Mount on start"
  control attempts of program to mount the filesystems on the connected
  devices, inserted removable media and during the start of
  the application, respectively.  By default all set to "false".
      All options can be also installed by editing of the configuration
  file ~/.config/tmount/tmount.conf, which is created when you first
  start "tmount".

      The program sees all the mountpoints created by the outside
  (by automounter, filemanager or manually), on the real or "loopback"
  devices, as well as using the "mount --bind", and invites the separate
  menu items for unmounting each of them individually.
      Note:  the "pmount" program, unlike the "udevil", can in this case
  work not properly, unmounting not the point that the specified.
  However, this is not the work of the fool the application.
      When starting this version of program wait the availability of
  the system tray up to 30 seconds, then silently ends, if it is not
  available.

      "tmount" use only "udev" and "procfs" functionality and require
  only libudev and Qt libraries.  This is Linux-specific program.
  Tested on qt-4.8.6, qt-5.5.1 and eudev 3.1.5.

      Installation:
      -------------

  1)  Make sure that the packages "qtcore", "qtgui" and "linguist" are
      installed.  In some distributions you may need "developers
      packages" - "-devel", "-tools" or similar.
  2)  Extract project directory from archive and "cd" to it.
  3)  Enter "lrelease tmount.pro" if you want to install
      the translations.  Currently only Russian translation present.
  4)  Type "qmake" to configure the program.  If you would like to
      install the program somewhere other than /usr, pass a new value
      for PREFIX variable during configuration, for example:
      "qmake PREFIX=/usr/local".
  5)  Enter "make" to build the application.
  6)  Type "sudo make install" (or "su -c 'make install'").
